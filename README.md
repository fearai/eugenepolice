python starter code to scrape the eugene oregon police log

enter your dates up top and run, you will get a printout of your results and they will also be saved to a csv file

if you are querying a big dataset you should pause a few seconds before hitting the police server and comment out the line print (localsave)

would be cool to see some predictive crime stats, crime changes over time, areas to avoid, mashitup with other datasets (weather? beer places?) etc.

free software, do what you want with it, please share what you do.
